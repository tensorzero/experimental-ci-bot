Please always provide EXACTLY ONE action in triple backticks, found {{actions|length}} actions.

If you want to end the task, use the completion command:

```bash
echo "COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT
DECISION: [INLINE_SUGGESTIONS|PULL_REQUEST]
REASONING: [Your reasoning here]"
```

Do not combine the completion command with any other command.

Otherwise, format your response exactly as follows:

<response_example>
THOUGHT: Your reasoning about why you want to perform this action.

```bash
<your_command_here>
```
</response_example>

Note: In rare cases, if you need to reference triple backticks in your command, proceed in two steps:
first write TRIPLEBACKTICKSBASH, then replace it with ```bash in a subsequent command.
