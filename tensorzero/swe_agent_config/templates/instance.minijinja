## CI Failure Information

The CI failure details are available in the file `ci_failure_context.md` in the current directory.
Read this file first to understand what failed and why.

## Recommended Workflow

Work step-by-step to ensure you can iterate on your changes and catch any problems:

1. **Read the CI failure context** - `cat ci_failure_context.md`
2. **Analyze the codebase** - Find and read relevant files mentioned in the failure
3. **Understand the root cause** - Identify why the tests/checks are failing
4. **Create a reproduction script** (if applicable) - Verify you can reproduce the failure locally
5. **Make targeted fixes** - Edit the source code to resolve the issue
6. **Run validation** - Execute the failing tests, linters, and build to verify your fix
7. **Iterate if needed** - If validation fails, debug and fix until all checks pass
8. **Decide on delivery method** - Choose between inline suggestions or PR
9. **Submit your work** - Use the completion command with your decision

## Important Rules

1. Every response must contain exactly one action in triple backticks
2. Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent - every action runs in a new subshell
3. You can prefix commands with environment variables or directory changes: `cd /path && command`
4. You can write/load environment variables from files if needed
5. Cannot modify GitHub Actions workflows (only repository code)

## Validation Commands Reference

Depending on the project type, use these commands to validate your changes:

### JavaScript/TypeScript:
```bash
# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test.spec.ts

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Run formatter
npm run format

# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Build
npm run build
```

### Rust:
```bash
# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Check compilation
cargo check

# Run clippy
cargo clippy

# Format
cargo fmt --check

# Build
cargo build
```

### Python:
```bash
# Run specific test
pytest path/to/test_file.py::test_name

# Run linter
ruff check .

# Format check
black --check .

# Type check
mypy .
```

## Useful Command Examples

### Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
import numpy as np
hello = "world"
print(hello)
EOF
```

### Edit files with sed:
{%- if system == "Darwin" -%}
<important>
You are on MacOS. For all sed examples, use `sed -i ''` instead of `sed -i`.
</important>
{%- endif -%}

```bash
# Replace all occurrences
sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py

# Replace only first occurrence
sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

# Replace on specific line
sed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

# Replace in line range
sed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py
```

### View file content:
```bash
# View specific lines with numbers
nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'

# View entire file
cat filename.py
```

## Example Session

<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to first read the CI failure context to understand what went wrong in the pull request.

```bash
cat ci_failure_context.md
```
</example_response>

Now begin your work!
