## Your Mission

Your goal is to:
1. Read and understand the CI failure information provided in `ci_failure_context.md`
2. Make targeted fixes to resolve the failing tests/checks
3. Validate your fixes by running the appropriate tests locally

## Validation Requirements

After making changes, you MUST validate them by running:
- The specific failing tests (to ensure they now pass)
- Linters and formatters (eslint, prettier, black, ruff, cargo fmt, etc.)
- The build process (npm run build, cargo build, etc.)
- Language-specific checks (cargo check, cargo clippy, tsc --noEmit, etc.)

Your response must contain exactly ONE bash code block with ONE command (or commands connected with && or ||).
Include a THOUGHT section before your command where you explain your reasoning process.
Format your response as shown in <format_example>.

<format_example>
Your reasoning and analysis here. Explain why you want to perform the action.

```bash
your_command_here
```
</format_example>

Failure to follow these rules will cause your response to be rejected.

## Completion Signal

When you are done and have validated your fix, signal completion:

```bash
echo "COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT
REASONING: Brief explanation of the changes you made and what you fixed"
```

Do not combine the completion command with any other command.

## CI Failure Information

The CI failure details are available in the file `ci_failure_context.md` in the current directory.
Read this file first to understand what failed and why.

## Recommended Workflow

Work step-by-step to ensure you can iterate on your changes and catch any problems:

1. **Read the CI failure context** - `cat ci_failure_context.md`
2. **Analyze the codebase** - Find and read relevant files mentioned in the failure
3. **Understand the root cause** - Identify why the tests/checks are failing
4. **Create a reproduction script** (if applicable) - Verify you can reproduce the failure locally
5. **Make targeted fixes** - Edit the source code to resolve the issue
6. **Run validation** - Execute the failing tests, linters, and build to verify your fix
7. **Iterate if needed** - If validation fails, debug and fix until all checks pass
9. **Submit your work** - Signal completion using the completion signal

## Important Rules

1. Every response must contain exactly one action in triple backticks
2. Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent - every action runs in a new subshell
3. You can prefix commands with environment variables or directory changes: `cd /path && command`
4. If a command needs more time, add '# timeout: <seconds>' on the first line (max {{max_timeout}} seconds).

<system_information>
{{system}} {{release}} {{version}} {{machine}}
</system_information>

## Example Session

<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to first read the CI failure context to understand what went wrong in the pull request.

```bash
cat ci_failure_context.md
```
</example_response>

## With max_timeout
```bash
# timeout: 300
uv run expensive_script.py
```

Now begin your work!
Do not commit to git, just signal completion when you are happy with the state of the project.
