THOUGHT: Your reasoning here.

```bash
your_single_command_here
```
</correct_format>

<completion_format>
To complete the task:

```bash
echo "COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT
REASONING: [Your explanation]"
```

The completion command must be alone—do not combine with other commands.

Note: If your command must contain literal triple backticks, first write a placeholder (e.g., BACKTICKS), then use sed to replace it in a follow-up command.
